For the the terminology applied to switches, consult http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay#Types_of_relay and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_switch#Contact_arrangements

Else we have defined these points :

SW-{P¦M}{A¦B¦C¦D}X

with :

1) {Permanent¦Momentary} kind of contact
2) X indicates the number of contacts
3) A for "make" or "Normally-open" (NO) contacts
   B for "break" or "Normally-closed" (NC) contacts
   C for "Change-over", or "double-throw" or "transfer", contacts control two circuits: one normally-open contact and one normally-closed contact with a common terminal
   D, same for C but when contact utilizes a "make before break" functionality

For the contacts, the pin numbers are :

NOx for Normally-Open x
NCx for Normally-Close x
COx for Common x
